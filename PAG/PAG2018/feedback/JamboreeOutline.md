# Proposed Annotation Jamboree Outline 

## Required to conduct exercises on GO functional annotation from literature:

- __Introduction to GO__: structure, understanding of biological process vs. molecular function, how users can browse GO.
- __Introduction to evidence & conclusion ontology__, and explanation on how users can browse the ECO.
- Read the __title__ of each article with attendees.
- Read each title and __explain the figure / table__ illustrating the annotation, AND read the statement that led to the assertion. 

## Presenting the exercises:

- Lay out a road map of steps attendees will take in order to *follow along*: e.g.: 
  - Step 1: Opening an account / logging in with ORCID. 
  - Step 2: Logging in to TOAST/GOAT/AnnotationTool (T/G/AT). 
  - Step 3: Reading statements from manuscript. 
  - Step 4: Visiting GO browser. 
  - Step 5: Visiting ECO browser. 
  - Step 6: Adding annotation(s) from paper into T/G/AT. 

- Clarify the flow of exercises. That is, instruct attendees that "during today's exercises you will:"
  1) Read the statements in the article. 
  2) Deduce whether it is biological process / molecular function / cellular component. 
  3) Define evidence in support of statement, and find an ECO term that describes this evidence. 
  4) Add this information to annotation tool. 

- Prepare ‘answer’ screencasts for each step for a single exercise (from beginning to end) and use said screencasts during presentation.
